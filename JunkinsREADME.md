- 👋 Hi, I’m @junkinsdev
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Java. I try to primarily focus on enterprise languages. I think there is a lot for the open source community to learn from large scale enterprise projects and vice versa. The enterprise level corporate structure in the United States has *A Lot* to learn from the open source community on project structure, community, methodology, inclusivity, and accessibility.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning .NET Core. I find it interesting. I like the Microsoft community. They have been great sharing knowledge and pointing me in the right direction. The community is very friendly and inclusive. I am not very pleased with the naming conventions. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... .NET open source projects. I am still learning coding in general. I have been coding for about three years of and on. But I think I can be of use. And I know the projects great people all around the world are building wonderful things. I want to be a part of that. 
- 📫 How to reach me.... Twitter is the easiest @junkins_john anywhere else I might be lurking will be @dunkelflaute. 
  
- Happy to meet you friend! Lets build something spicy. Oh.. and tell me your conspiracy theories! I don't believe them. I just love hearing about them. The human mind can come up with some wild shit.
